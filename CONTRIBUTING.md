# Contributing to mac-setup

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to mac-setup!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking questions or providing feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome! If you have questions or comments, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/monsieurborges/mac-setup/issues).

## Reporting issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in mac-setup? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look for an existing issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/monsieurborges/mac-setup/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç upvote
* üëé downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing good bug reports and feature requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Your operating system

* Reproducible steps (1..., 2..., 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

## Thank you
